# Uganda Elections 2021 Data

This repository contains files and code required to convert election results as publicly released by the Uganda Electoral Commission (in pdf form) into Excel and Stata formats. Results are reformatted to assign district, subcounty and parish, and associated numeric codes, to each polling station.

## Code and Data

All original pdfs of polling station level results by district can be found in [pres_results_pdf](UG_elections2021/pres_results_pdf) and as converted into xlsx in [pres_results_xlsx](UG_elections2021/pres_results_xlsx). Code to append the xlsx results and organize data in the form District/Subcounty/Parish/Polling Station can be found in [pres_results_code](UG_elections2021/pres_results_code).

Final datasets in xlsx and dta formats can be found in [pres_results_final_datasets](UG_elections2021/pres_results_final_datasets).
