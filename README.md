# Uganda Elections 2021 Data

This repository contains files and code required to convert election results as publicly released by the Electoral Commission of Uganda into Excel and Stata formats. Results are reformatted to assign district, subcounty and parish, and associated numeric codes, to each polling station.

## Code and Data

All original pdfs of the polling station level results by district have been converted to xlsx files, which can be accessed in the folder "pres_results_xlsx".

Code to append the xlsx results and organize data in the form District/Subcounty/Parish/Polling Station can be found in the folder "pres_results_code".

Final datasets in xlsx and dta formats can be found in the folder "pres_results_final_datasets".

Original pdfs of the polling station level results by district can be found in this [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3zdi7p19zj6288d/AAALxw2FYB1w1uF9YqjsjGfoa?dl=0). These pdfs were downloaded from the Electoral Commission of Uganda on January 30, 2021, from the page [2021 Presidential Results Tally Sheets by District](https://www.ec.or.ug/2021-presidential-results-tally-sheets-district).
